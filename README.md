This project is paused at this time. Main missing features are staggering:

* Very basic AI. We still have some ambition for this part, or at least we hope to have fun trying to make it better!
* No internet remote server ability. This can be another fun part to add. Implementing GTP would be one too.
* No real GUI yet. The simplistic GUI working in a web browser has the convenient advantage to allow us to test the program using a mouse instead of entering all the moves in console mode... This is why it was coded.
